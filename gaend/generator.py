# Probably wondering why fx instead of just hard coded values? Keys are
# really built with the application_id as part of the key. Because the
# application_id when a test first starts up is different than the
# application_id afterwards, the key will be different in the "compile"
# (first pass) execution of this code than the "runtime" execution of
# this code. Therefore you need to dynamically build the key at
# runtime with a function.

# This is all the ndb.*Property under test. A few Properties were not tested
# as they seemed depreciated or unecessary. Note that ndb.ComputedProperty is
# included in the set of classes for each property in ./tests/generator_test.py
#
# Untested Property Types:
# ndb.BlobKeyProperty - Holdover from `db` days?
# ndb.UserProperty - Google recomends not using this
# ndb.GenericProperty - Why not just use ndb.Expando class?
#
# DEV NOTE: I remaing unconvinced that ndb.*StructuredProperty are worth their
# added mental complexity. I feel that you would almost always be better off
# creating additional full fledged entities and then refering to them by key.
# Unless your application has substantial performance or data size constraints,
# I feel that anything that can be done with a structured property can more
# understandably be done with multiple writes with transactions.
# tldr; I have chosen not to test them, but will be happy to accept pull request
# that do!
